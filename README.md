## Ask Me About

### Industry Experience
As a full-stack software developer, I work on projects in the water industry, primarily developing web pages and automating tools and processes for stakeholders. My work involves both front-end and back-end development, with a strong focus on clean, maintainable code that aligns with our coding standards and best practices. I follow established principles in software engineering, prioritising code readability, scalability, and robustness, and adhere to rigorous testing and QA procedures as part of our CI/CD pipeline. We use Azure DevOps for code review and pull request management, and Git for version control to ensure consistency across the development lifecycle.
